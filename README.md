# GPU-Accelerated-Climate-and-Water-Level-Forecasting-System-using-Deep-Learning
This project develops a high-performance, GPU-accelerated system for forecasting climate variables and water levels using advanced deep learning models. Leveraging multi-GPU architectures, the system incorporates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer-based models

## Overview
A production-ready system using deep learning (LSTM + Transformer) with GPU acceleration for forecasting water levels and climate variables. Targets 5-10x training speedup and 20-50x preprocessing acceleration vs CPU.

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline (in progress)

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (to be added)
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in API keys/paths

## Next Steps
- Day 2: Set up PyTorch with CUDA and verify GPU access
- Full documentation coming in docs/

## License
